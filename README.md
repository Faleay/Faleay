ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Faleay. 
I am a Russian student who really wants to learn everything about creating applications and ESPECIALLY games.
At the moment I know very little, but I am ready to learn everything in a big way.


- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in back-end and game-dev
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# (Basics, Winforms/WPF, C# in Unity) but now I'm thinking about Java instead of C#
- ğŸ“« How to reach me anbroid03@gmail.com
