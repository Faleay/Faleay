## Who am I?
Hey everyone! I'm Russian student who wants to find my profession in IT sphere.

Now I'm learning Java to create Minecraft mods...
But also I'm very interested in game-dev on Unity which means another Object-Oriented language is needed to me and this language is C#.
I will update information about myself as I search for my profession in IT.

## My repositories
At the moment I have only one repository where I post my solutions to codewars,
but later, as I learn programming, my mods for Minectaft and games on Unity will appear there
